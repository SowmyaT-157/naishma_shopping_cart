#  TypeScript CLI E-Commerce App

A command-line e-commerce application built using **TypeScript** and **Node.js**, designed to simulate basic Admin and Customer interactions in an e-commerce environment. Admins can manage the product catalog, while customers can browse, filter, and add products to a cart — all via the terminal using prompt-sync.
